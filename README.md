# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction with Linear Regression

## Overview

Medical Insurance Cost Prediction is a machine learning project focused on predicting the cost of medical insurance based on various factors such as age, sex, BMI, children, smoker status, and region using linear regression.

## Features

  Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for model training.
  
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding data distribution and relationships between features.
  
  Model Training: Implementing a linear regression model to predict insurance costs.
  
  Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error and R-squared.

## Project Structure

  medical-insurance-cost-with-linear-regression.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the entire workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
  
  insurance.csv: Dataset used for training and testing the model.
